# postfix [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/cloudposse/postfix.svg)]()

This is project implements as a docker container a postfix mail server. It supports a configurable hostname, trusted hosts, proper
shutdown handling and mail relay (e.g. to mailgun).

## Notes

By default, connected rfc1918 networks are detected and allowed. Local networks 
(127.0.0.1, ::1) are also allowed.

## Syslog

Rsyslog is started automatically and sends logs to stdout

## Suggested Volumes

  * `/var/spool/postfix` is the spool directory. Its also where postfix chroots to by default.
  * `/etc/postfix` is the configuation directory
  
## Configuration

You can customize the image behavior using environmental variables or entrypoint
arguments.

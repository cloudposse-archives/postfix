# postfix [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/cloudposse/postfix.svg)]()

This is project implements as a docker container a postfix mail server. It supports a configurable hostname, trusted hosts, proper
shutdown handling and mail relay (e.g. to mailgun).

## Notes

By default, connected rfc1918 networks are detected and allowed. Local networks 
(127.0.0.1, ::1) are also allowed.

You can optionally enable the Carrier Grade NAT, RFC6598 (100.64.0.0/10).  
RFC1918 is still the default.  RFC6598 does not include the RFC1918 subnets, because
CGN is not meant to be used at the same time as private subnets.  If you really want 
both, you'll need to override the entrypoint to include both arguments.

## Syslog

Rsyslog is started automatically and sends logs to stdout

## Suggested Volumes

  * `/var/spool/postfix` is the spool directory. Its also where postfix chroots to by default.
  * `/etc/postfix` is the configuation directory
  
## Configuration

You can customize the image behavior using environmental variables or entrypoint
arguments.

# Development

## Units tests

Regexp unit tests can be executed by running

`cd ./rootfs/`

`./test_ip_regexps`

Any output should be fixed.
